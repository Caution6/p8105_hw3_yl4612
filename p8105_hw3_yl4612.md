### Problem 1

``` r
data("instacart")
```

Short description of the dataset:

This dataset contains 1384617 rows and 15 columns.

Observations are the level of items in orders by user. There are user /
order variables – user ID, order ID, order day and order hour. There are
also item variables – name, aisle, department, and some numeric codes.

How many aisles, and which are most items from?

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 x 2
    ##    aisle                              n
    ##    <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5 packaged cheese                41699
    ##  6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617
    ##  7 milk                           32644
    ##  8 chips pretzels                 31269
    ##  9 soy lactosefree                26240
    ## 10 bread                          23635
    ## # ... with 124 more rows

Let’s make a plot.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  filter(n > 10000) %>% 
  mutate(
    aisle = factor(aisle),
    aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n)
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

Let’s make a table.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  count(product_name) %>% 
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) %>% 
  filter(rank < 4) %>% 
  arrange(aisle, rank) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

| aisle                      | product\_name                                 |    n | rank |
| :------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | ---: | ---: |
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                             |  499 |    1 |
| baking ingredients         | Pure Baking Soda                              |  387 |    2 |
| baking ingredients         | Cane Sugar                                    |  336 |    3 |
| dog food care              | Snack Sticks Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog Treats |   30 |    1 |
| dog food care              | Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe           |   28 |    2 |

| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                          | 9784 |    1 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries                           | 5546 |    2 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                           | 4966 |    3 |

Apples vs ice cream ..

``` r
instacart %>% 
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>% 
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>% 
  summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = order_dow,
    values_from = mean_hour
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` regrouping output by 'product_name' (override with `.groups` argument)

    ## # A tibble: 2 x 8
    ## # Groups:   product_name [2]
    ##   product_name       `0`   `1`   `2`   `3`   `4`   `5`   `6`
    ##   <chr>            <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>
    ## 1 Coffee Ice Cream  13.8  14.3  15.4  15.3  15.2  12.3  13.8
    ## 2 Pink Lady Apples  13.4  11.4  11.7  14.2  11.6  12.8  11.9

### Problem 2

Load, tidy and otherwise wrangle the data.

``` r
accel_df =
  read_csv("./accel_data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    activity_1:activity_1440,
    names_to = "minute_of_the_day",
    names_prefix = "activity_",
    values_to = "activity_count"
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    day = factor(
      day, 
      levels = c("Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday")
      ),
    minute_of_the_day = as.numeric(minute_of_the_day),
    weekday_vs_weekend = recode(
      day,
      Monday = "weekday",
      Tuesday = "weekday",
      Wednesday = "weekday",
      Thursday = "weekday",
      Friday = "weekday",
      Saturday = "weekend",
      Sunday = "weekend"
    ),
    weekday_vs_weekend = factor(weekday_vs_weekend)
  ) %>% 
  arrange(week, day) %>% 
  select(-day_id)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_double(),
    ##   day = col_character()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

Describe the resulting dataset:

The resulting dataset contains variables including week, day,
minute\_of\_the\_day, activity\_count, weekday\_vs\_weekend. I arrange
the dataset according to “week” variable firstly, then by “day”
variable. “minute\_of\_the\_day” variable shows each minute at specific
day of the specifc week. “activity\_count” variable shows activity
counts for each minute of a 24-hour day starting at midnight.
“weekday\_vs\_weekend” variable shows type of this day.

In total, there are 50400 observations.

Create a table showing total activity over the days.

``` r
accel_df %>% 
  group_by(week, day) %>% 
  summarize(activity_of_the_day = sum(activity_count)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = day,
    values_from = activity_of_the_day
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` regrouping output by 'week' (override with `.groups` argument)

    ## # A tibble: 5 x 8
    ## # Groups:   week [5]
    ##    week Sunday  Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday  Friday Saturday
    ##   <dbl>  <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>   <dbl>    <dbl>
    ## 1     1 631105  78828. 307094.   340115.  355924. 480543.   376254
    ## 2     2 422018 295431  423245    440962   474048  568839    607175
    ## 3     3 467052 685910  381507    468869   371230  467420    382928
    ## 4     4 260617 409450  319568    434460   340291  154049      1440
    ## 5     5 138421 389080  367824    445366   549658  620860      1440

Trend apparent:

On Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, total activities over the day are
relatively stable. In weekend, there is an apparent trend of decrease.

Make a single panel plot.

``` r
accel_df %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = minute_of_the_day, y = activity_count, color = day)) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) + 
    labs(
      title = 'Activity counts for each minute of a 24-hour day',
      x = 'minute of the day',
        y = 'activity count'
        )
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam' and formula 'y ~ s(x, bs = "cs")'

<img src="p8105_hw3_yl4612_files/figure-gfm/s_p_p-1.png" width="90%" />

Describe any patterns or conclusions I can make based on this graph:

From the plot, the 63 year-old male might sleep from 11:30 p.m to 7:00
a.m. On Sunday, he is more active than the other days in the morning. On
Sunday and Tuesday, he is less active than the other days in the
evening.
